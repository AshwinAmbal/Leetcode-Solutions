429. N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

We should return its level order traversal as a List of Lists:

[
     [1],
     [3,2,4],
     [5,6]
]
 

Note:

The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
The total number of nodes is at most 5000.
